--> DO THIS :exclamation: 
Consider user stories:
A user story is a lightweight method for quickly capturing the **"who"**, **"what"** and **"why"** of a product requirement. 
- <type of user> WHO. Who are we building this for? Who is the user?
- <some feature> WHAT. What are we building? What is the intention?
- <some reason> WHY. Why are we building it? What is the value for the customer?
