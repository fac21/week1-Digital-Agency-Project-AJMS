---

- Planned out the Kanban board together.

--- 

### Pairing

- We swapped pairs every hour (or 30 mins)
- Met as a 4 to discuss what we'd achieved after every pair session.
- Everyone got a chance to work with everyone!
- Back-seat driver pairing technique

---

### Challenges

- Technical/zoom issues
- Differing opinions
    - Planning vs research
    - User-focus vs basic code writing
- Taking turns with speaking
- Time efficiency

---

### What we did well with pairing

- Everyone always knew what was going on
- Everyone learned something new every day

---

### Quotes of the week

- "Squirrel" - Antonio's interpretation of the `@` symbol.
- "We met at the sweat pot" - Sevda (*sweet spot*)

## Project Content

---

- Digital agency specialising in websites for musicians.
- Oush! (because we typed `git push` wrong so many times!)

---

We are a digital agency with our target focused on musicians. 

This night performance idea inspired our colour palette. In consideration of accesibility,  we made a contrast of light colours.
